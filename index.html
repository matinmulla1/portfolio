            <p>
                During my internship at Compsoft Technologies, I worked on a project titled ArtGallery, which focused on developing a responsive and interactive web interface for displaying categorized art collections. My primary responsibilities included designing and implementing the user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a strong emphasis on creating a smooth and intuitive user experience. I was actively involved in optimizing image rendering, ensuring responsive design across various devices, and enhancing the overall visual appeal of the application. This experience not only strengthened my front-end development skills but also gave me valuable exposure to real-world project workflows and UI/UX best practices.

            <p>
                The SmartShop project involved building a fully functional e-commerce web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the DummyJSON API. I was responsible for developing dynamic product listings, enabling users to browse and interact with a variety of items in real time. The application featured a responsive shopping cart system that utilized local storage to preserve cart data, along with real-time total price calculation and seamless user interaction. This project allowed me to apply core web development concepts and strengthen my skills in API integration, client-side storage, and interactive UI design, while simulating a real-world online shopping experience.
